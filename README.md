## What is Psysonic?

Psysonic is a desktop music client for self-hosted music libraries. It is designed for people who want the freedom of their own server without giving up the comfort, polish and speed of a modern music app.

It is built with **Rust**, **Tauri v2** and **React**, with a strong focus on responsiveness, customization, practical music-library workflows and a user interface that does not require a manual before you can press play.

Psysonic is **optimized first and foremost for Navidrome**. Other Subsonic-compatible servers can work well too, but advanced features may depend on server-side support.
