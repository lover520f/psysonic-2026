 * just handed to the mutation) by id — **purely structural**: no resolver cache
 * read and no F4 override merge (display still applies those), so the derived
 * array is byte-identical to the old fat-array mutation result. The ref is the
 * source of truth for the queue-only flags. A ref with no pooled track falls
 * back to a placeholder (does not happen during dual-write, where every ref's
 * track is in hand). Removed in the final step together with `queue: Track[]`.
